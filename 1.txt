Abnormal Brain
To describe a lesion you should mention the following points:
•	Definition [well defined, ill- defined]
•	Shape [oval, rounded, irregular…]
•	Size [-----x------x------ cm in maximal AP, transverse and cranio caudal diameters respectively]
•	Site [intra axial, extra axial, frontal,parietal, …..]
•	Surrounding edema [If present]
•	Mass effect which includes 
o	effacement of the cortical sulci
o	Compression of the ventricle
o	Midline shift
•	Signal intensity in T1, T2 and FLAIR images 
       possibilities include: 
Low   T1      high T2 [many lesions]
            			High T1       high T2  [subacute blood]
             			Low T1        low T2  [vessels, calcium, ...]
             			High T1       intermediate T2 [fat,...]
             			Intermediate T1 and T2 [some lesions]



 ? Intra cerebral hemorrhage
? A well defined, oval shaped area of blood signal is seen in the …..       
       [Mention the site of the lesion]. It showed ……….
•	If blood is recent [intermediate signal in T1WIs with very dark signal in T2WIs].
•	Early sub acute blood [high signal in T1WIs and dark signal on T2WIs] [intracellular met HB].
•	Late sub acute blood [high signal in all pulse sequences] [Extracellular met HB].
•	Chronic blood [very dark signal in all pulse sequences] [hemosidren].
NB   In cases of hematoma with mixed signal either you say 
•	The hematoma showed mixed signal intensities , its major part showed ….. in T1WIs and ……. In T2WIs, while the smaller part showed …. In T1WIs and …… in T2WIs.
OR 	? The hematoma showed mixed signal intensities, it's central part   
                 showed …… in T1WIs and ….. in T2WIs while it's peripheral part   
                 showed …… in T1WIs and …. In T2WIs.

NB 	In case you see a black line surrounding the hematoma you say a rim 
of persistent low signal in all pulse sequences is seen surrounding the hematoma denoting hemosidren formation.

NB 	A narrow zone of peripheral brain edema my be identified around the 
hematoma showing low signal in T1WIs and high signal in T2WIs.

 ?The lesion measures ----x ----x --- cm maximal AP, transverse and 
     craniocaudal diameters respectively.
?The lesion exerts a mass effect in the form of effacement of the cortical 
      sulci ? compression of the ipsilateral ventricle ? contra lateral shift of the   
      midline structures.
?Normal posterior fossa (if the lesion is not in the posterior fossa).
